Architect turned software engineer - I am a recent Makers Academy graduate keen to learn new skills and excited to apply myself in a full-stack junior software engineer role. As a very creative and friendly professional, I love coming up with new ideas and realising them with a team of like-minded people.
After many years of studying and practicing Architecture, I wanted a new challenge where my problem-solving skills and innate curiosity can be applied. I decided to join the world of Tech with it being one of the most fast-paced and innovative industries. Having a close group of software engineer friends, I was able to see this ever-evolving community which has inspired this change in me. With my previous experience as an Architect and newly acquired skills at Makers Academy,  I am excited to work in a forward-thinking friendly environment to make amazing projects come to reality.

## Skills

### Teamwork and Leadership

As someone who was a practicing Architect for many years, I have plenty of experience leading and participating in varied teams of people. I enjoy social interactions and enabling the projects to evolve in a fun yet efficient way. I also strongly believe that sharing quality information and coaching is essential for a healthy working environment.

**Key Achievements:**
- I was a lead Architect of an office building project for several years and in this role, you need to not only lead a team of your fellow architects but also coordinate all the consultants and heavily engage with the contractor and client teams. To complete any architectural project you need to be able to communicate your ideas clearly, manage your and your team's time efficiently and be able to respond quickly to any arising queries. 

- At Makers, I had an opportunity to use my teamwork skills in several group projects. I was facilitating as much of clear visual communication as possible: I took charge of creating mock-ups, mind-maps, and other useful means of devising an efficient plan for the team. Generally, Makers is a very-team oriented boot camp that encourages communication and knowledge exchange.

### Problem Solving and Analysis

I can quickly analyse new environments to see the necessary constraints and swiftly move on to figuring out the best way forward. I have plenty of experience ranging from devising a brief with the client to dealing with construction issues on site.

**Key Achievements:**
- Every architectural project has myriads of constraints ranging from client's interests, budgets, and urban planners' visions to building regulations, sustainability, and environmental concerns. One needs to take all of these constraints into account and create something not only passable but comfortable, beautiful, and unique.

- During my 12 weeks at Makers, we were thrown into so many different environments where we adapted both in a group and individually and created some interesting projects. The challenge was to be able to quickly assess the problem and what needs to be studied to achieve the goal in areas that were not familiar to me at the time. It was a very empowering experience.

### Creativity and Design Skills

- Studying and working for many years in Architecture I have very strong design skills. An urge to achieve the cleanest, neatest, and most aesthetically pleasing solution is now ingrained in me forever. I also think that being playful and curious in the initial stages of design usually helps to achieve a truly unique outcome.

**Key Achievements:**
- My student and professional Architectural portfolio contain many a project both academic and built of varying degrees of complexity. Every stage of the project requires a different application of design skills: from a larger urban scale to the tiniest joinery detail.

- I applied my design skills not only to the coding areas to make the code as clear as possible but also took care of a pleasant user experience. I contributed some fun art to make the apps more interactive and contributed to a clean and user friendly-design.

### Fast Learner

This was mostly proven at the Makers course where we were given tonnes of new and interesting information. I was impressed with my ability to filter the information and compose it to be useful in achieving specific goals. I was unfamiliar with most of the concepts and tools taught at the course, but it didn't stop me to throw myself into this whirlwind of new information. I view challenges as opportunities for self-improvement.


## Experience

### Squire and Partners
*Architect (2016 - 2020)*

#### Cavendish Place Project
I had an opportunity to be a project Architect for an eight-storey office building just off Regent Street from a very early design stage through construction. This demanded knowledge and experience of delivering a project, excellent design, communication & problem-solving skills, and the ability to effectively manage a team of people. 

**Challenges Overcome:**
  - Design of the building that is contemporary yet fits the historic surroundings with Portland stone cladding and zinc mansard roof
  - A heavily constrained plot of land with Party walls to all sides
  - An escape corridor from Westminster University that had to be active at all times of construction from demolition to erection of the building
 
#### Space House
Interior lead for an £80M(construction value) 1960s tower refurbishment project in Holborn, I was responsible for coordinating and delivering all the interior architectural packages and lead a team of people. This was a great experience working on a very complex project with large architectural and consultant teams.

**Challenges Overcome:**
  - Working on a listed building and a London landmark
  - Adapting a 1960s building to fit modern comfort and sustainability requirements
  - Designing bespoke mechanical ventilation solutions to optimise floor to ceiling heights
  - Working with manufacturers to achieve sculptural interior features
  
#### Gordon House Studios
Project architect of a refurbishment of an old Army and Navy store warehouse to create a contemporary office space. I started working on this project just graduating from the Architectural school as an Architectural Assistant role and finishing as a Project Architect. 

**Challenges Overcome:**
  - Original features were preserved and treated which required a lot of research, tests, and samples
  - New polished concrete floors, thin folded metal staircase, and metal bridges were designed and developed with the manufacturers to complement the existing building fabric
  - The lower ground floor was a trench-covered hundred and fifty-year-old plant area with old electric machines and enormous water tanks. The whole area had to     be carefully cleared, levelled, and treated to be inhabitable
  - We had to build a new UKPN substation, which required a lot of communication and negotiation with Power Networks.
 
### Squire and Partners (2013 - 2016)  
_Part II Architectural Assistant_

During this time I was taking part in lots of projects with different uses, scales, and complexity. After architectural school, it was important to acquire more practical skills, such as knowledge of various regulations, practice operation, and working through various stages of the project in a team.
