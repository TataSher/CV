## Experience

**Squire and Partners** (2016 - 2020)  
_Architect_

- I had an opportunity to be a project Architect for an office building just off Regent Street from a very early design stage through construction. This involves knowledge and experience of delivering a project, excellent design, communication & problem solving skills and the ability to effectively manage a team of people.
- I was also an interior lead (a person in charge of a mini-team responsible for all the interior elements) for a 1960s tower refurbishment project in Holborn. This was a great experience working on a very complex project with a larger team.

**Squire and Partners** (2013 - 2016)  
_Part II Architectural Assistant_

- I was taking part in lots of projects with different uses, scales and complexity. After an architectural school it was important to acquire more practical skills, such as knowledge of various regulations, practice operation and working through various stages of the project in a team.

## Skills

#### Excellent Design Skills

- Studying and working many years in Architecture I have very strong design skills. A strong urge to achive the cleanest, neatest and aesthetically pleasing solution is now ingrained in me forever.

#### Leading a project from inception to completion

- I worked on several architectural projects from very early stages through to completion. Having this experience enables one to realise what to spend the time and effort on at every stage. Completing a big project teaches you time management and organisational skills, how to set and achieve goals at every stage and how to find effective solutions under pressure.
