## Skills

### Teamwork

As someone who was a practicing Architect for many years I have plenty of experience leading and participating in varied teams of people. I enjoy social interactions and enabling the projects to evolve in a fun yet efficient way. I also strongly believe that sharing quality information and coaching are essential for a healthy working environment.

**Key Achievements:**
- I was a lead Architect of an office building project for several years and in this role you need to not only lead a team of your fellow architects, but also coordinate all the consultants and heavily engage with the contractor and client teams. To complete any architectural project you need to be able to communicate your ideas clearly, manage your and your team's time efficiently and be able to respond quickly to any arising queries. 

- At Makers I had an opportunity to use my teamwork skills in several group projects. I was facilitating as much of a clear visual communication as possible: I took charge of creating mock-ups, mind-maps and other useful means of devising an efficient plan for the team. Generally Makers is a very-team oriented bootcamp that encourages communication and knowledge exchange.

#### Problem Solving and Analysis
I can quickly analyse new environments to see the necessary contstraints and swiftly move on to figuring out the best way forward. I have plenty of experience ranging from devising a brief with the client to implementing the best solution.

**Key Achievements:**
- Every architectural project has miriads of constraints ranging from client's interest, urban planners' visions and budgets to building regulations, sustainability and environmental concerns. One needs to take all of these constraints into account and create something not only passable but comfortable, beautiful and unique.

- During my 12 weeks at Makers we were thrown into so many different environments where we adapted both in a group and individually and created some interesting projects. The challenge was to able to quickly assess the environment and what needs to be studied to achieve a goal in areas that were not familiar to me at all. It was a great and empowering experience.




#### Excellent Design Skills

- Studying and working many years in Architecture I have very strong design skills. An urge to achive the cleanest, neatest and the most aesthetically pleasing solution is now ingrained in me forever. I also think that being playful and curious in the initial stages of design usually help to achieve a truly unique outcome.

**Key Achievements:**
- My student and professional Architectural portfolio contains many a project both academic and built of varying degrees of complexity. Every stage of the project requires a different application of design skills: from a larger urban scale to the tiniest joinery detail.

- I applied my design skills not only to the coding areas to make the code as clear as possible but also took care of a pleasant user experience. I contributed some fun art to make the apps more interactive and contributed in a clear and user friendly design.



## Experience

**Squire and Partners** (2016 - 2020)  
_Architect_

- I had an opportunity to be a project Architect for an office building just off Regent Street from a very early design stage through construction. This demands knowledge and experience of delivering a project, excellent design, communication & problem solving skills and the ability to effectively manage a team of people.
- I was also an interior lead (a person in charge of a mini-team responsible for all the interior elements) for a 1960s tower refurbishment project in Holborn. This was a great experience working on a very complex project with a larger team.

**Squire and Partners** (2013 - 2016)  
_Part II Architectural Assistant_

- I was taking part in lots of projects with different uses, scales and complexity. After an architectural school it was important to acquire more practical skills, such as knowledge of various regulations, practice operation and working through various stages of the project in a team.
