## Skills

### Teamwork

As someone who was a practicing Architect for many years I have plenty of experience leading and participating in varied teams of people. I enjoy social interactions and enabling the projects to evolve in a fun yet efficient way. I also strongly believe that sharing quality information and coaching are essential for a healthy working environment.

**Key Achievements:**
- I was a lead Architect of an office building project for several years and in this role you need to not only lead a team of your fellow architects, but also coordinate all the consultants and heavily engage with the contractor and client teams. To complete any architectural project you need to be able to communicate your ideas clearly, manage your and your team's time efficiently and be able to respond quickly to any arising queries. 

- At Makers I had an opportunity to use my teamwork skills in several group projects. I was facilitating as much of a clear visual communication as possible: I took charge of creating mock-ups, mind-maps and other useful means of devising an efficient plan for the team. Generally Makers is a very-team oriented bootcamp that encourages communication and knowledge exchange.

#### Problem Solving and Analysis
I can quickly analyse new environments to see the necessary constraints and swiftly move on to figuring out the best way forward. I have plenty of experience ranging from devising a brief with the client to dealing with construction issues on site.

**Key Achievements:**
- Every architectural project has miriads of constraints ranging from client's interests, budgets and urban planners' visions to building regulations, sustainability and environmental concerns. One needs to take all of these constraints into account and create something not only passable but comfortable, beautiful and unique.

- During my 12 weeks at Makers we were thrown into so many different environments where we adapted both in a group and individually and created some interesting projects. The challenge was to be able to quickly assess the problem and what needs to be studied to achieve the goal in areas that were not familiar to me at the time. It was a very empowering experience.

#### Creativity and Design Skills

- Studying and working many years in Architecture I have very strong design skills. An urge to achive the cleanest, neatest and the most aesthetically pleasing solution is now ingrained in me forever. I also think that being playful and curious in the initial stages of design usually help to achieve a truly unique outcome.

**Key Achievements:**
- My student and professional Architectural portfolio contains many a project both academic and built of varying degrees of complexity. Every stage of the project requires a different application of design skills: from a larger urban scale to the tiniest joinery detail.

- I applied my design skills not only to the coding areas to make the code as clear as possible but also took care of a pleasant user experience. I contributed some fun art to make the apps more interactive and contributed in a clear and user friendly design.

#### Fast Learner

This was mostly proven at Makers course where we were given tonns of new and interesting information. I was impressed with my ability to filter the information and compose it to be useful in achieving a specific goals. I was unfamiliar with most of the concepts and tools taught at the course, but it didn't stop me to throw myself into this whirlwind of new information. I view challenges as opportunities for self improvement.


## Experience

**Squire and Partners** (2016 - 2020)  
_Architect_

- I had an opportunity to be a project Architect for a an eight storey office building just off Regent Street from a very early design stage through construction. This demanded knowledge and experience of delivering a project, excellent design, communication & problem solving skills and the ability to effectively manage a team of people. 

- I was also an interior lead (a person in charge of a mini-team responsible for all the interior elements) for a £80M(construction value) 1960s tower refurbishment project in Holborn. This was a great experience working on a very complex project with a larger team of about 10 people.

**Squire and Partners** (2013 - 2016)  
_Part II Architectural Assistant_

During this time I was taking part in lots of projects with different uses, scales and complexity. After an architectural school it was important to acquire more practical skills, such as knowledge of various regulations, practice operation and working through various stages of the project in a team.
